# NamelessMC XAuthConnect Module

A NamelessMC module offering secure OAuth2 authentication by integrating with XAuthConnect as an external identity provider.

## Features

- **Secure OAuth2 Authentication:** Integrate your NamelessMC forum with your XAuthConnect server for robust and secure user logins.
- **User Linking & Registration:** Seamlessly link existing NamelessMC accounts with XAuthConnect identities or allow new users to register using XAuthConnect.
- **Admin Panel Configuration:** Easily configure XAuthConnect client ID, client secret, and issuer URL directly from the NamelessMC admin panel.
- **Customizable:** Utilizes NamelessMC's integration framework for easy customization and extension.

## Requirements

- NamelessMC version 2.2.3 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- `xauth/oauth2-xauthconnect` library installed via Composer in your NamelessMC root directory.
- An active XAuthConnect server (e.g., `https://xauth-server.com`)
- An XAuthConnect application configured with the correct Redirect URI.

## Installation

1. **Install `xauth/oauth2-xauthconnect` library:**
   Navigate to your NamelessMC root directory and run:
   ```bash
   composer require xauth/oauth2-xauthconnect
   ```

2. **Upload Module Files:**
   Copy the contents of the `upload/` directory from this module's repository into the root directory of your NamelessMC installation.

3. **Enable the Module:**
   - Log in to your NamelessMC admin panel.
   - Navigate to `Modules`.
   - Find "XAuthConnect Integration" and click "Install".
   - Ensure the module is enabled.

4. **Configure XAuthConnect:**
   - In the NamelessMC admin panel, navigate to `Integrations` -> `XAuthConnect`.
   - Enter your XAuthConnect **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Issuer URL**.
   - Note the **Redirect URI** displayed on this page.

5. **Configure your XAuthConnect Application:**
   - Go to your XAuthConnect application settings.
   - Add the **Redirect URI** obtained from the NamelessMC admin panel to your XAuthConnect application's allowed redirect URIs.

## Usage

Once configured and enabled, users will see a "Login with XAuthConnect" option on your NamelessMC login and registration pages. Clicking this will redirect them to your XAuthConnect server for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

- **Module not appearing:** Ensure all files from the `upload/` directory were copied correctly to your NamelessMC root.
- **OAuth2 errors:** Double-check your Client ID, Client Secret, Issuer URL, and Redirect URI in both NamelessMC and your XAuthConnect application settings.
- **Composer issues:** Ensure `xauth/oauth2-xauthconnect` is correctly installed via Composer.
- **NamelessMC logs:** Check your NamelessMC error logs for more detailed information.
